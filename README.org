#+title: DalamudPackager

This is an MSBuild task that is designed to simplify creating plugins
for [[https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud][Dalamud]].

Install the NuGet package ~DalamudPackager~. When you build in release
mode, a folder will be placed in your output directory containing your
plugin manifest and ~latest.zip~.

* Table of contents                                                     :TOC:
- [[#configuration][Configuration]]
- [[#manifest-generation][Manifest generation]]
- [[#yaml-manifests][YAML manifests]]
- [[#csproj-manifests][csproj manifests]]
- [[#zip-file-generation][~.zip~ file generation]]
- [[#task-attributes][Task attributes]]

* Configuration

If you need to additionally configure the task, create a file called
~DalamudPackager.targets~ in your project and use the template below.

#+begin_src xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
    <Target Name="PackagePlugin" AfterTargets="Build" Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
        <DalamudPackager
                ProjectDir="$(ProjectDir)"
                OutputPath="$(OutputPath)"
                AssemblyName="$(AssemblyName)"
                MakeZip="true"/>
    </Target>
</Project>
#+end_src

* Manifest generation

DalamudPackager reduces the amount of keys you need to include in your
manifest, filling in the rest from sane defaults or your assembly. You
can, of course, specify everything manually.

#+begin_src json5
{
    "Name": "Test Plugin",
    "Author": "You",
    "Description": "This is a test plugin",
    "RepoUrl": "https://example.com/"
}
#+end_src

Notice how keys like ~AssemblyVersion~ and ~DalamudApiLevel~ are
missing. You can include these if you'd like, but DalamudPackager will
automatically do it for you when you build your project. If you build
a project with this manifest in Release mode, you will find the
following JSON file in your output directory.

#+begin_src json5
{
  "Author": "You",
  "Name": "Test Plugin",
  // this will be set to your AssemblyName automatically
  "InternalName": "TestPlugin",
  // this will be set to your assembly's version automatically
  "AssemblyVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "Description": "This is a test plugin - this first line is a summary.\n\nDown here is a more detailed explanation of what the plugin\ndoes, manually wrapped to make sure it stays visible in the\ninstaller.",
  // this will be set to "any" automatically
  "ApplicableVersion": "any",
  "RepoUrl": "https://example.com/",
  // this will be set to 2 automatically
  "DalamudApiLevel": 2,
  // this will be set to 0 automatically
  "LoadPriority": 0
}
#+end_src

* YAML manifests

In addition, DalamudPackager allows you to use YAML, a more
human-friendly format, for your manifest instead of JSON. YAML uses
*snake_case* for keys instead of PascalCase like JSON. All the
features of DalamudPackager work with YAML manifests. Just end your
manifest's file name with ~.yaml~ instead of ~.json~ to make use of
it.

#+begin_src yaml
name: Test Plugin
author: You
description: |-
  This is a test plugin - this first line is a summary.

  Down here is a more detailed explanation of what the plugin
  does, manually wrapped to make sure it stays visible in the
  installer.
repo_url: https://example.com/
#+end_src

* csproj manifests

If you prefer to keep your configuration in your ~.csproj~ file, you can specify
almost all manifest fields directly as properties.

#+begin_src xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <Author>You</Author>
    <Name>Sample Plugin</Name>
    <MinimumDalamudVersion>13.0.0</MinimumDalamudVersion>
    <Punchline>A short one-liner that shows up in /xlplugins.</Punchline>
    <Description>A description that shows up in /xlplugins. List any major slash-command(s).</Description>

* ~.zip~ file generation

DalamudPackager will also create a folder with ~latest.zip~ for you if
~MakeZip~ is ~true~. Check your output directory for a folder with the
name of your assembly. Inside will be your manifest and ~latest.zip~,
ready for distribution or PRs.

Note that the entire contents of your output directory will be zipped
by default. Either turn off copy local for Dalamud references, set up
a task to clean your output directory, or use ~Exclude~ or ~Include~
if you want to change this.

* Task attributes

If you set ~ManifestType~ to ~csproj~, you can specify your manifest fields directly in the task attributes. The following table lists all available attributes:

| Attribute               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required | Default                           |
|-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------|
| ~ProjectDir~            | This is the path where your ~csproj~ is located. You must set this to ~$(ProjectDir)~.                                                                                                               | *Yes*    | /None/ - set to ~$(ProjectDir)~   |
| ~OutputPath~            | This is the path that your assemblies are output to after build. You must set this to ~$(OutputPath)~.                                                                                               | *Yes*    | /None/ - set to ~$(OutputPath)~   |
| ~AssemblyName~          | This is the name of the assembly that Dalamud will be loading. You used to need to specify this in your manifest as ~InternalName~.                                                                  | *Yes*    | /None/ - set to ~$(AssemblyName)~ |
| ~ManifestType~          | You can choose between ~auto~, ~json~, ~yaml~, and ~csproj~ for your manifest file. ~auto~ will use ~json~ first, then fall back on ~yaml~, then fall back on ~csproj~.                              | No       | ~auto~                            |
| ~VersionComponents~     | How many components of the assembly's version to include in the generated manifest. If you use semantic versioning, set this to ~3~.                                                                 | No       | ~4~                               |
| ~MakeZip~               | If this is ~true~, a folder will be created in your ~OutputPath~ that contains your generated manifest and ~latest.zip~, reading for PRing.                                                          | No       | ~false~                           |
| ~Exclude~               | Files to exclude from the zip if ~MakeZip~ is ~true~. Mutually exclusive with ~Include~. Files should be separated by a semicolon (~;~) and be relative to ~OutputPath~. Files do not need to exist. | No       | /None/                            |
| ~Include~               | Files to include in the zip if ~MakeZip~ is ~true~. Mutually exclusive with ~Exclude~. Files should be separated by a semicolon (~;~) and be relative to ~OutputPath~. Files must exist.             | No       | /None/                            |
| ~Author~                | Manifest field defined as csproj property for the plugin's author.                                                                                                                                   | No       | /None/                            |
